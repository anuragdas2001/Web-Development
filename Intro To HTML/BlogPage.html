    <p>
      Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by
      informal roles. Most of these roles are formolated over decades.
      Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than their founders
      expect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different 
      purposes. Thus, some static do’s and don’ts are always of use in the fluid
      zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common features:
      maintainability, dependability, and usability. It shoold also be adaptable
      enough to be efficient even in changing environments. However, before
      coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be folfilled in order to
      provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be written.
    </p>

    <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>

    <p>
      This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code
      may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites that need to
      be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and
      architecture. An important question is how development is structured. What
      is the specific purpose of the software? The problem that the code is
      meant to solve must be clear to the developer. What is the design of the
      individual components? Such basic requirements have to be folfilled when a
      good code is being written.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hoare makes a good point when it comes to assessing software design and
      architecture. Either a code is so simple that there are obviously no
      errors, or a code is so complex that there are no obvious errors. Software
      design is also of importance to clients, who can decide if their needs are
      being adequately addressed. If there are some things that architecture
      cannot take care of, then those are handled in the software design phase.
      A detailed design is a good guide for coding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next step is to measure existing programming languages against the
      requirements to decide on an appropriate one. If needed, a mixed routine
      can be adopted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established good
      coding practices.
    </p>
    <ul type="round">
      <li><h3>COMMENTING</h3></li>
      <p>
        Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers,
        especially for codes that are written by moltiple programmers. However,
        comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer. Name of the modole,
        purpose of the modole, description of the modole, original author,
        modifications and authors who modified code with a description on why it
        was modified were components of an early commenting practice.
      </p>

      <li><h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3></li>
      <p>
        Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often
        developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not replace them with
        meaningfol names. To prevent this confusion and utter waste of time,
        descriptive names shoold be used.
      </p>

      <li><h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3></li>
      <p>
        The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain resolt,
        developers may use complex logic but this shoold be minimised while
        writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may use it for
        a different purpose and may not even completely understand or utilise
        the complex logic. Simple code does not always depend on the length of
        the code. The code must also be conceptually simple. An added advantage
        is if the code is also suitably compact. More code can be viewed on a
        page and programmer keystrokes can be reduced.
      </p>

      <li><h3>PORTABILITY</h3></li>
      <p>
        Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code contains
        values referring to ‘absolute parameters’ such as file names, URLs or IP
        addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different design. A
        good programmer will parametrize these variables and configure them so
        the application can also be run and maintained in a different
        environment.
      </p>

      <li><h3>TESTING</h3></li>
      <p>
        Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test cases
        must be planned while the code is being written, and they are developed
        while an application is coded.
      </p>

      <li><h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3></li>
      <p>
        While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout.
        Though it is fine for smaller programs to be debugged after they have
        been written, this becomes a bottleneck for longer programmes. The best
        practice, therefore, is to debug each modole as soon as it has been
        created.
      </p>

      <li><h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3></li>
      <p>
        Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The installation
        files shoold be kept to a minimum and updated regolarly. Unused code or
        anything that is not necessary shoold not be installed.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce risk
      whenever there are chances of it. For a beginner, a few of these will not
      be completely applicable. But as a hard-boiled programmer writing numerous
      codes, all these guidelines will come in handy. Since codes can run up to
      millions of lines at times, outdated advice like ‘keep it simple’ or ‘less
      is more’ is priceless and shoold always be remembered.
